## Site content
A landing page, including a photo of me, with placeholder links for projects to come!  The page features responsive design, and a parallax-scrolling inset.

This site uses [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), though I started with [purecss](http://purecss.io/).

Design elements and implementation guidance came from templates at [http://purecss.io/layouts/marketing/](http://purecss.io/layouts/marketing/) and [https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio/](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio/)

I use a font (Roboto Slab) that I found using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab). 

I gave up on css-transform based parallax, because of poor cross-browser compatibility.  I left a comment in the html where it was stripped out, including the sites that inspired the technique.
